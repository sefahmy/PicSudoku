# PicSudoku

• Developed a web app where users can upload an image of a sudoku board and the algorithm would determine if it is a valid board then solve it 
• Utilized OpenCV line detection to detect patterns and that indicate a Sudoku board is present     
• Implemented KerasOCR to process an image, then detect where the number and spaces are 
• Saved 5 seconds of runtime with image processing and proper complex data structure usage 
• Solves the board using a backtracking algorithm
• Script writes the final answer onto a blank image utilizing Python Imaging Library
